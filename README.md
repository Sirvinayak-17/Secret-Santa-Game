# Secret Santa Project

## Introduction
This project automates the Secret Santa gift exchange process for the company "Acme." It assigns a Secret Child to each employee, ensuring the following constraints:
- An employee cannot be assigned themselves.
- No employee is assigned the same Secret Child as the previous year.

The program reads employee information and last year's assignments from CSV files, processes the data, and outputs a new set of assignments.
